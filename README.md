# Nat's Portfolio Website

Hi! This is all of the code for [my website](https://nwhalen2.github.io/nat).
I chose React/NodeJS for my tech stack and have any relevant data stored in JSON, since it's not much :) Check it out!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
